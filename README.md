Geeknote for Evernote (or 印象笔记)  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jeffkowalski/geeknote.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jeffkowalski/geeknote)
===

Geeknote is a command line client for Evernote that can be use on Linux, FreeBSD and OS X.

It allows you to:
* create notes in your Evernote account;
* create tags, notebooks;
* use Evernote search from the console using different filters;
* edit notes directly in the console using any editor, such as nano, vim or mcedit;
* synchronize your local files and directories with Evernote;
* use Evernote with cron or any scripts.

Geeknote is open source and written in Python. Geeknote can be used anywhere you have Python installed (even in Windows if you like).

In this document we'll show how to work with Evernote's notes, notebooks, and tags using Geeknote and how to use Geeknote sync.

## Installation
You can install Geeknote using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)/[Linuxbrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/linuxbrew), or from its source.

##### Homebrew installation

``` sh
brew install --HEAD https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeffkowalski/geeknote/master/geeknote.rb
```

##### Downloading and installing from source

``` sh
# Install dependencies. (This example for Debian-based systems):
sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get -y install python-setuptools

# Download the repository.
git clone git://github.com/jeffkowalski/geeknote.git

cd geeknote

# Installation
python setup.py build
sudo pip install .
```

##### Testing
Geeknote has a non-destructive unit test suite with fair coverage.

Ensure pytest framework is installed
``` sh
sudo apt-get install python-pip; sudo pip install -U pytest
```

Execute the tests
``` sh
py.test
```

## Geeknote Settings
##### Authorizing Geeknote
After installation, Geeknote must be authorized with Evernote prior to use. To authorize your Geeknote in Evernote launch the command *login*:

``` sh
geeknote login
```

This will start the authorization process. Geeknote will ask you to enter your credentials just once to generate access token, which will be saved in local database. Re-authorization is not required, if you won't decide to change user.
After authorization you can start to work with Geeknote.

##### Logging out and changing users
If you want to change Evernote user you should launch *logout* command:

``` sh
geeknote logout
```

Afterward, you can repeat the authorization step.

##### (Yìnxiàng Bǐjì notes)

If you want to use Evernote's separate service in China Yìnxiàng Bǐjì (印象笔记),
you need to set the environment variable `GEEKNOTE_BASE` to `yinxiang`.

``` sh
GEEKNOTE_BASE=yinxiang geeknote login
# or
export GEEKNOTE_BASE=yinxiang
geeknote ...commands...
```

Yìnxiàng Bǐjì (印象笔记) is faster in China and it supports Chinese payment methods.
Be aware that Yìnxiàng Bǐjì will not have support for sharing social features
like Twitter or Facebook. Furthermore, since data are stored on servers in China,
Chinese authorities have the right to access their data according to current
regulations.

## Working with Notes
### Notes: Creating notes
The main functionality that we need is creating notes in Evernote.

##### Synopsis

``` sh
geeknote create --title <title>
               [--content <content>]
               [--tags <list of tags>]
               [--created <date and time>]
               [--resource <attachment filename>]
               [--notebook <notebook where to save>]
               [--reminder <date and time>]
```

##### Options

| Option     | Argument | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| ‑‑title    | title    | With this option we specify the title of new note we want to create. |
| ‑‑content  | content  | Specify the content of new note. The content must not contain double quotes. |
| ‑‑tags     | list of tags, like: tag1, tag2 | Specify tags that our note will have. Multiple tags are separated with comma. |
| ‑‑created  | date     | Set note creation date and time in either 'yyyy-mm-dd' or 'yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM' format. |
| ‑‑resource | attachment filename, like: document.pdf |Specify file to be attached to the note.  May be repeated. |
| ‑‑notebook | notebook where to save | Specify the notebook where new note should be saved. This option is not required. If it isn't given, the note will be saved in default notebook. If notebook doesn't exist Geeknote will create it automatically. |
| ‑‑reminder | date     | Set reminder date and time in either 'yyyy-mm-dd' or 'yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM' format. Alternatively use TOMORROW and WEEK for 24 hours and a week ahead respectively, NONE for a reminder without a time. Use DONE to mark a reminder as completed. |
| --raw      |          | A flag signifying the content is in raw ENML format. |

##### Description
This command allows us to create a new note in Evernote. Geeknote has designed for using in console, so we have some restrictions like inability to use double quotes in **--content** option. But there is a method to avoid it - use stdin stream or file synchronization, we show it later in documentation.

##### Examples

Creating a new note with a PDF attachment:

``` sh
geeknote create --title "Shopping list"
                --content "Don't forget to buy milk, turkey and chips."
                --resource shoppinglist.pdf
                --notebook "Family"
                --tags "shop, holiday, important"
```

Creating a new note and editing content in editor (notice the lack of `content` argument):

``` sh
geeknote create --title "Meeting with customer"
                --notebook "Meetings"
                --tags "projectA, important, report"
                --created "2015-10-23 14:30"

```

### Notes: Searching for notes in Evernote

You can easily search notes in Evernote with Geeknote and output results in the console.

##### Synopsis

``` sh
geeknote find --search <text to find>
             [--tags <tag list>]
             [--notebooks <notebook list>]
             [--date <date or date range>]
             [--count <how many results to show>]
             [--exact-entry]
             [--content-search]
             [--url-only]
             [--reminders-only]
             [--ignore-completed]
             [--with-tags]
             [--with-notebook]
             [--guid]
```

##### Description

Use **find** to search through your Evernote notebooks, with options to search and print more detail. Geeknote remembers the result of the last search. So, you can use the ID number of the note's position for future actions.
For example:

``` sh
$ geeknote find --search "Shopping"

Total found: 2
  1 : Grocery Shopping List
  2 : Gift Shopping List

$ geeknote show 2
```

That will show you the note "Gift Shopping List".

##### Examples

Renaming the note:

``` sh
geeknote edit --note "Naughty List" --title "Nice List"
```

Renaming the note and editing content in editor:

``` sh
geeknote edit --note "Naughty List" --title "Nice List" --content "WRITE"
```

### Notes: Showing note content

You can output any note in console using command *show* either independently or as a subsequent command to *find*. When you use *show* on a search made previously in which there was more than one result, Geeknote will ask you to make a choise.

##### Synopsis

``` sh
geeknote show <text or GUID to search and show>
```

##### Examples

``` sh
$ geeknote show "Shop*"

Total found: 2
  1 : Grocery Shopping List
  2 : Gift Shopping List
  0 : -Cancel-
: _
```

As we mentioned before, *show* can use the results of previous search, so if you have already done the search, just call *show* with number of previous search results.

``` sh
$ geeknote find --search "Shop*"

Total found: 2
  1 : Grocery Shopping List
  2 : Gift Shopping List

$ geeknote show 2
```

| ‑‑force            |                 | A flag that says that Geeknote shouldn't ask for confirmation to remove note. |

## gnsync - synchronization app

Gnsync is an additional application installed with Geeknote. Gnsync allows synchronization of files in local directories with Evernote. It works with text data and html with picture attachment support.

##### Synopsis

``` sh
gnsync --path <path to directory which to sync>
      [--mask <unix shell-style wildcards to select the files, like *.* or *.txt or *.log>]
      [--format <in what format to save the note - plain, markdown, or html>]
      [--notebook <notebook, which will be used>]
      [--all]
      [--logpath <path to logfile>]
      [--two-way]
      [--download]
```

##### Options

| Option             | Argument        | Description |
|--------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| ‑‑path             | directory to sync | The directory you want to sync with Evernote. It should be the directory with text content files. |
| ‑‑mask             | unix shell-style wildcards to select the files | You can tell *gnsync* what filetypes to sync. By default *gnsync* tries to open every file in the directory. But you can set the mask like: &#042;.txt, &#042;.log, &#042;.md, &#042;.markdown. |
| ‑‑format           | in what format to save the note - plain or markdown | Set the engine which to use while files uploading. *gnsync* supports markdown and plain text formats. By default it uses plain text engine. |
| ‑‑notebook         | notebook where to save | You can set the notebook which will be syncronized with local directory. But if you won't set this option, *gnsync* will create new notebook with the name of the directory that you want to sync. |
| ‑‑all              |                 | You can specify to synchronize all notebooks already on the server, into subdirectories of the path. Useful with --download to do a backup of all notes. |
| ‑‑logpath          | path to logfile | *gnsync* can log information about syncing and with that option you can set the logfile. |
| ‑‑two-way          |                 | Normally *gnsync* will only upload files. Adding this flag will also make it download any notes not present as files in the notebook directory (after uploading any files not present as notes) |
| ‑‑download-only    |                 | Normally *gnsync* will only upload files. Adding this flag will make it download notes, but not upload any files |

##### Description
The application *gnsync* is very useful in system adminstration, because you can syncronize you local logs, statuses and any other production information with Evernote.

##### Examples

``` sh
gnsync --path /home/project/xmpp/logs/
       --mask "*.logs"
       --logpath /home/user/logs/xmpp2evernote.log
       --notebook "XMPP logs"
